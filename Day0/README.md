# Day 0 - The first day of DevLeague

## Pre-Requisites
DevLeague prep studying materials should be completed by this time, and all students should have a Unix based operating system ready to go.

## Class Format / Time to Allow for Subject
This material usually takes 1 full day to introduce. We will spend the whole first week working on covering the basics.

# Suggested Format for Delivery
The following format is meant to be a guideline for effective delivery. Instructors can present material in another way if it is more effective for the students.

* Welcome - Intro - Orientation (Lecture)
  * Student Intros, Instructor Intros (whiteboard)  
    * What's your name? (and what do you want to be called)
    * Where are you from?
    * What programming / engineering experience do you have?
    * What do you want to get out of the bootcamp?
      * Desired outcome?
      * Job? at what kind of company?

* Guidelines for success
  - Self-teaching

  - Have fun

* [Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)
  1. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.
  1. You are not your code.
  1. No matter how much "karate" you know, someone else will always know more.
  1. Don't rewrite code without consultation.
  1. Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.
  1. The only constant in the world is change.
  1. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.
  1. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.
  1. Don't be "the guy in the room."
  1. Critique code instead of people.
