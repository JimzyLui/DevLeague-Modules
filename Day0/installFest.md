# Install Fest
If you have already installed any of these programs before, then you may skip it.

## [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) **osx only**
- Ubuntu/Linux flavors can use instead use the Terminal application that comes installed.

## [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/#install) **osx only**

## Install Node through Homebrew
**OSX**
1. run the command `brew install nodejs` (this will give us the NPM command which we will use later in this doc)

**Ubuntu/Linux**

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nodejs npm
sudo npm i -g n
sudo n stable
sudo npm i -g npm
```

## [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
First install VS Code!  
Install the `code` command: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line  

Once VS Code is installed, 
- Go to the Settings panel
- Look for "Editor: Tab Size"
- Set this value to "2"
- Click on the "Editor: Detect Indentation" click in the instructions for "Editor: Tab Size"
- Disable "Detect Indentation"

## Install [Oh-My-ZSH Shell](http://ohmyz.sh/)

- **OSX:** follow the instructions in the via curl tab
- **Linux:** follow the instructions in the via curl tab

### Change your theme to `pygmalion`

**Install VIM editor**
- **OSX**: Follow these instructions
  - `brew install vim`

- **Ubuntu:** Follow these instructions
  - `sudo apt-get -y update`
  - `sudo apt-get install vim`
  - `sudo update-alternatives --config editor` then select the number that references: `/usr/bin/vim`

Now VIM will be your default editor in the command-line!

**Opening your zsh configuration file**
`code ~/.zshrc`

**Moving around in vim**
Move your cursor down with the `J` key and `L` to move right. (also, `H` is left, and `K` is Up). **YOUR MOUSE WILL NOT WORK**

In your `.zshrc` file, using the movement keys the line with the code `ZSH_THEME` and change it to `ZSH_THEME="pygmalion"`

Press `i` to go into insert mode to make changes.
When ready to save and exit, press `ESC` to leave Insert Mode and go back to Command Mode. Now you can move around again with the movement keys.

### Useful plugins
With the `.zshrc` file still open in `vim`, find the line with the code `plugins` and change it to look like the line below, order doesn't matter:

`plugins=(osx git npm brew github node)`

### Enabling some helpful aliases
find the code near the bottom of the `.zshrc` file:

```
  # Example aliases
  # alias zshconfig="subl ~/.zshrc"
  # alias ohmyzsh="subl ~/.oh-my-zsh"
```

change to (remove the `#` and space after it; this a code comment in the `bash` language):

```
  # Example aliases
  alias zshconfig="subl ~/.zshrc"
  alias ohmyzsh="subl ~/.oh-my-zsh"
```

### Save and reload your configuration
While in Command Mode (press `ESC` key a few times to make sure you are in Command Mode), press the `:` key then type `wq` and hit <kbd>Enter</kdb>. You have now saved and exited  the `vi` program.

Type the command: `source ~/.zshrc` into your terminal to reload the configuration file.
