# DevLeague Modules

## WIP

Modules that are prepended with a `-` are ready to be formatted.

Modules that are prepended with a `_` are *empty*.

## Module Structure

Each module may contain a sub-module, in which case, only contains directories for each sub-module

Each module contains a README.md which is the primary document to start from.

_see module **Module README.md template** below_

Each module may contain sub-directories, given that they are described and referenced from the README

## Module README.md template

see [OOP Module](OOP/) for an example

> # [Module name]
>
> ## Suggested order of delivery
>
> 1. Intro (whiteboard)
> 1. [Slideshow](https://github.com/DevLeague/slides-Intro-to-OOP/)
> 1. [JS Constructors](https://github.com/DevLeague/js-constructors)
> 1. Difference Classes, Objects, Inheritence (talk)
> 1. [Kingdom of OOP](https://github.com/devleague/Kingdom-of-OOP)
> 1. Check in, understanding of constructors, inheritence, and super calls (talk)
> 1. verify (acceptance)
>
> ## Topics
>
> - a list of topics for this module
> - define a level of understanding for each topic
> - example:
>     - Defining Classes [grok]
>     - Instantiating Objects [grok]
>     - Class Inheritence [grok]
>     - Interfaces [teach]
>     - Polymorphism [about]
>     - Multiple Inheritence [about]
> - where:
>     - [grok] => Grokking a topic
>     - [teach] => ability to communicate topic to colleagues in a way they can teach it or know about it
>     - [about] => knows about a topic at a high level enough to know it exists and do further research as needed
>
> ## Acceptance
>
> - criteria used to determine completion of this module
> - answers these questions:
>     - what have the students learned?
>     - what can a student do to demonstrate knowledge or mastery?
>     - how do we know that a student has obtained proper training?

##### TASKS THAT NEED TO BE ADDED TO CURRICULUM:
- [100 Specs](https://github.com/devleague/100-Specs)
- [Be Positive](http://class.sandbox.devleague.com/Be-Positive.zip)
- [PixelPainter](https://github.com/devleague/PixelPainter)
- Morning Challenges should be added to curriculum in the relevant modules

##### REEVALUATE THESE TASKS:
These are tasks that are out of date and should be revaluated
- [Context Exercise](https://github.com/devleague/Context-Exercise)
  - We could use some more examples here
- [bruhdash](https://github.com/devleague/bruhdash)
  - Haven't used this one for a while
- [Warrior Js](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs)
  - Never seen this one used - also, it's not official DL curriculum
- [Technophile](https://github.com/devleague/Technophile)
  - Multiple Inheritence
- [Sir-Mix-Alot](https://github.com/devleague/Sir-Mix-Alot)
  - Students struggle to understand the point or the context, and it's v hard
- [DOM Cloud](https://github.com/devleague/DomCloud)
  - V challenging recursion challenge
- [What year is it?](https://github.com/devleague/What-Year-Is-It)
- [Calls from the Highest Order](https://github.com/devleague/Calls-from-the-Highest-Order)
- [Delta Force](https://github.com/devleague/Calls-from-the-Highest-Order)
  - Event Emitter exercise - we need more of these. Can we bring it back?
- [Rebirth of reddit](https://github.com/devleague/rebirth-of-reddit)
  - Let's use real XHR data, not dummy data.
- [AJAX Slides](http://slides.com/jasonsewell/ajax-schmajax#/)
  - Should we still teach XHR or should we switch to Fetch. Or both?
- [TODO Crud](https://gist.github.com/theRemix/4b630a417ee5764079db)
- [America Online](https://githaub.com/devleague/America-Online)
- [Meteor](https://gist.github.com/jaywon/16c18ebc3037ab9c5839)
  - https://slides.com/jasonsewell/meteor-day/
- [bashercise](https://github.com/devleague/bashercise)
  - Bash Pracitce
- [Don't string Me Along](https://github.com/devleague/dont-string-me-along)
- [Rock, Paper, Fireball](https://gist.github.com/theRemix/c81b72cfe004cba879b3)

##### Ideas for slides or Modules
- Cookies
- Authentication
- Sessions
- Redis??? Do we want to cover this???
- D3 - Students use every cohort, maybe we should make a assignment or slides to cover it.
- Performance
- Agile Development
