## Whiteboard Indexing

Describe how indexing would work illustrated as an unindexed set of data, array of objects.

Explain the concept of indexing.

Then create a separate object to track "indexed" columns in the array of objects, and demonstrate what a query on a table with indexed columns would look like using the "index".


## Whiteboard Denormalized to Normalized

Have a large whiteboard of a table of duplicated values.

Step by step, interactively create related tables to normalize the single table into multiple relations.
